1) The code is run and tested on MacOS. Cmake is used to compile

2) I didn't receive any help for the assignment

3) No reference used

4) When we press 'A', it shows two axes instead of one, which keeps toggling between the two as we press 'A'. I haven't looked at the source of the problem, mainly because it wasn't part of the requirement. 

5) No extra credit.

6) It was really fun.
